# The Environmental Context of Fire Severity: Global Patterns and Insights  

## Overview  
This project investigates global patterns in wildfire severity by analyzing how historical fire activity, weather, and vegetation interact to influence potential fire outcomes.  
The analysis combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models to identify which environmental and temporal factors are most predictive of wildfire severity. Accompanying reports and slides summarize the key insights and limitations.  

## Key Features  

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Integrated global wildfire and environmental datasets, handled missing values, and engineered temporal and environmental features.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized global fire distributions, correlations between vegetation stress, climate indicators, and fire severity.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Created variables such as months since last fire, season progress, fires per year (by country), and vegetation stress to capture temporal context.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented classification models including Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting with class balancing to predict fire severity levels.  
- **Evaluation:** Compared model accuracy and recall metrics, with a focus on correctly identifying severe fires.  
- **Presentation Slides & Report:** Summarize analytical process, results, and key takeaways in clear visual and written formats.
